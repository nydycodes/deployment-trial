# deployment-trial
this is the trial for cloud deployement of our web application 'HealthCloud', which monitors the health status of heart patients.
after assessing all the attributes, a result will be displayed informing the patient whether or not they have heart diseases.
the code for the website is available in my other repository 'HealthCloud'.
the website is available on 'https://healthcloud.onrender.com/'.

the inspiration for this project was taken from the paper 'HealthCloud: A system for monitoring health status of heart patients using machine learning and cloud computing' available on 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542660521001244'.
